# infNEP
Algorithms for solving infinite-dimensional non-linear eigenvalue problems, and examples.

The code is presented as a gallery of examples for producing the results of the paper<br>
<b>Matthew J. Colbrook, Alex Townsend, "Avoiding discretization issues for nonlinear eigenvalue problems"</b><br>
Please reference this paper if you use the code.

The subfolder "inf_dim_functions" contains routines, including the infinite-dimensional version of Beyn's algorithm.

The subfolder "computed_data" contains results of the algorithm for some of the plots.

Some of the code makes use of the Chebfun software package for computing with functions, available for download at https://www.chebfun.org/ and the NLEVP collection, available for download at https://github.com/ftisseur/nlevp
